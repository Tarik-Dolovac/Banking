# Simple Banking System

This is a simple banking system project written in Java.  
I built this project while learning Java basics such as:
- Variables
- Methods
- Loops
- Switch statements
- User input handling

## Features

- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Check account balance
- Simple password login
- Option to continue or exit

## How it works

When the program starts:
1. You enter your full name.
2. You log in with a password.
3. You can choose to deposit, withdraw, or check your balance.
4. After each action, you can decide to continue or exit.

The starting balance is set to **100 euros** by default.

## Technologies

- Java 21
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VSCode (any Java IDE)

## Future Improvements

- Add user account creation
- Save balance between sessions
- Handle invalid input better
